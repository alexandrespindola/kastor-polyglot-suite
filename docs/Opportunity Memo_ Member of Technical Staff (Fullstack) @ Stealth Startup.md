4. **Applied ML:**  
   * **LLMs and prompt engineering**.  
   * **Fine-tuning LLMs**.

### **4\. Preparation Strategy (for Nov 4th Interview)**

* **Primary Goal:** To create a "Proof of Concept" (PoC) dashboard that provides tangible, interactive proof of all 4 key skill sets from the job description.  
* **Core Project:** Build the **"Kastor Polyglot Suite"** (React, Hono/Bun, MongoDB, Windmill, n8n).  
* **Project Alignment with Role:**  
  * **React Frontend:** Matches the "Frontend Development" requirement.  
  * **Hono/Bun API Gateway:** Serves as the "Node.js" component, demonstrating a modern, high-performance API.  
  * **n8n \+ Gemini API Module:** Directly matches "Applied ML," "LLMs," and "prompt engineering."  
  * **Windmill \+ Python Module:** Matches "Python is a plus". O script será usado para demonstrar orquestração de dados e **integração direta com AWS S3** (usando boto3 para salvar resultados), cobrindo o requisito de **"AWS backend services"**.  
  * **Windmill \+ Go Module:** Directly matches "Go or motivation to learn it" by using Go for its core strength (concurrency).  
  * **Overall Architecture (Hono \-\> Windmill/n8n):** Serves as direct proof of understanding **"Event-driven architectures."**  
* **Key Talking Points:**  
  * This project demonstrates a single engineer orchestrating a full *polyglot* (multi-language) system, which is essential for a "10x" team.  
  * Reinforce the conceptual bridge: GCP Certified (GKE, Cloud Run, IAM) translates directly to AWS (EKS, Fargate, IAM). A integração com S3 no projeto é a prova prática dessa ponte.  
  * Reinforce logistical advantages (EU Citizen in Germany).
